{"name": "玛丽亚娜·希尔 Marianna Hill", "intro": "A familiar character actress, Mariana Hill was the daughter of a building contractor, who moved his family around. In addition to living in her native Southern California, Hill has lived in Canada, Spain and Great Britain. As a result, she learned and became quite accomplished in doing different accents and dialects. Whether it's a French accent (from a guest appearance on My Three Sons (1960)) or German (Hogan's Heroes (1965)), Hill could be counted on to belt it out. She started acting while a teenager, apprenticing at the La Jolla (Calif.) Playhouse, and also studied at the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York City. Having beautiful, exotic looks certainly didn't hurt her either as she has played a Hawaiian girl, Irish lass and Greek beauty. In addition, she has been a model and was an acting coach and teacher at the Lee Strasberg Institute in London.", "pictures_index": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/celebrity/s_ratio_celebrity/public/p1386685088.94.webp", "sex": "女", "star": "水瓶座", "birthday": "1941-02-09", "birthplace": "美国,圣巴巴拉加州", "url": "/celebrity/1099345/"}
