To be able to read exactly what is written without omitting anything that is written and at the same time without adding anything of one's own. To be able to capture the exact context of the words one is reading. To be able to read!\"", "pictures_index": "https://img9.doubanio.com/view/celebrity/s_ratio_celebrity/public/p4824.webp", "sex": "男", "star": "处女座", "birthday": "", "birthplace": "法国", "url": "/celebrity/1050528/"}
